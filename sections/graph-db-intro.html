    <h3>Graphs</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "In the most common sense of the term, a <strong>graph</strong> is an ordered pair $G=(V,E)$
        compromising a set $V$ of <strong>vertices</strong> together with a set $E$ of <strong>edges</strong>,
        which are 2-element subsets of $V$ [with some additional <strong>properties</strong>]."

    <h3>Graph databases</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "In computing, a <strong>graph database</strong> is a database that uses graph structures for
        <strong>semantic queries</strong> with <strong>nodes</strong>, <strong>edges</strong> and
        <strong>properties</strong> to represent and store data."

    <h3>Relational database</h3>
    <blockquote>
        "A <strong>relational database</strong> is a digital database whose organization is based on the relational
        model of data [...] This model organizes data into one or more <strong>tables</strong>  (or "relations")
        of <strong>columns</strong> and <strong>rows</strong>, with a unique key identifying each row."

        <tr>
            <td align="center">Relational</td><td align="center">Graph</td>
        </tr>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>With Graph databases, relationships are first class citizens.</li>
        <li>Very easy to add new relationships to existing models.</li>
        <li><strong>If the data fits the model, you get a very suitable, intuitive way of querying the data.</strong></li>
        <li>Use the right tool for the job!!!</li>
    </ul>
